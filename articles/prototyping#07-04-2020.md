In the last quarters, I did a lot of work in improving the general modeling experience for the [dmn-js toolkit](https://bpmn.io/toolkit/dmn-js/). We decided for an approach which would rather go with building prototypes instead of real features. 

This allowed us experimenting, ellaborating and iterating a lot with the huge amount of decision modeling ideas we had at the beginning. Along this road I learnt a lot, so I decided to write down my thoughts about the overall process and what, from my experience, makes a prototype _efficient_.

### Background: Agile Prototyping

Generally saying we moved along an _Agile Prototyping_ process while creating our prototypes. I won't go too much into detail about that topic, [this blog post](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/agile/agile-design-prototype) explains it quite good.

What we keen to do all the time was to improve our prototypes with each iteration. Beginning with the most important or most obvious feature, we tried to add more and more to the actual demo, until we were sure the original feature fits our needs. This included a couple of user tests to verify our assumptions, or to improve the demo with our findings. 

Starting with a demo instead of a real implementation gave us enough flexibility to try out multiple things for a certain problem. We were simply not coupled to internal conventions `dmn-js` would have given us.

Once we have to tackle a bigger problem, about which we do not know much yet, it makes totally sense to start with that approach. Take the time to experiment and learn about the problem before you're actually start solving it. The next chapters should explain about some learning I've made during this time 

### Know the use case

...Find a user story...interactions...

### Innovation + inspiration

...Do a pre-research step...

### Start with a pen

...from sketch to demo...

### It's not a feature branch

...do not build prototypes on the real codebase...

### Keep it simple

...build less features, do not reinvent the wheel...

### Build fast, fail faster

...plan multiple iterations, user tests, do not hold up from throwing parts away...

### Think about variations

...variant toggles...

### Keep the best

...decide on a final variant and plan the implementation...

As another exciting pet project we created a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension for rendering BPMN 2.0 process diagrams. It is built on top of the amazing modeling toolkit [bpmn-io](https://bpmn.io/) and can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/pinussilvestrus/vs-code-bpmn-i). 

You can directly download it from [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salaboy.vs-code-bpmn-io) or [follow the setup instructions](https://github.com/pinussilvestrus/vs-code-bpmn-io#development-setup) to get it running locally. 

With this extension it is possible to display a preview for your BPMN 2.0 diagrams. It also refreshes the preview whenever you re-focus it, to adapt made changes in the xml content.

As a next step, we plan to also add a modeling functionality to enable the powerful BPMN diagram editing capabilities of `bpmn-io`. This will help to easily create BPMN process diagrams in Visual Studio Code without writing one line of XML.

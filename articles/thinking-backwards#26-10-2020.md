Where to start? Every product work begins with this question; let it be concepting a complete new product idea, creating a simple feature enhancement or fixing a crucial bug.

I once wrote [another blog post](https://dev.to/pinussilvestrus/creating-the-unknown-what-and-what-not-to-build-in-efficient-prototypes-467p) about prototyping and how to use it to tackle uncertain problems. 

At [Camunda](http://camunda.com/) we follow the strategy to keep our work focus. One thing at a time, but doing this one thing right. That's great, but how do you know what this *one thing* is?

One principle my team more or less actively used in the past is to *work backwards*. This could sound like guessing the right solution, right? Let me explain.

### Working Backwards Â© Amazon

The idea of working backwards is not new, [Amazon "introduced" it a while ago](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/amazon-uses-a-secret-process-for-launching-new-ideas-and-it-can-transform-way-you-work.html). At the very beginning of developing new products, the product manager, or even better the team, writes an internal press release about the finished product. Before creating a single user story, without writing a single line of code.

The press release should be customer focussed, stating how current solutions are failing and why users will be amazed by the new product. Heaving this as a "solution sketch" they start iterating, keep on improving it. The key here: "Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!)" (Ian McAllister). 

I never wrote such a press release as the working backwards method requires. What's important to me here are the principles which are behind. That's why I'd rather call it *Thinking Backwards*. It does not start with a press release, a MVP, a mockup or a prototype. It starts with thinking.

### It's all about shaping

### Begin with the problem - jump back if necessary

### Find the Big Why

### Begin with the onboarding
